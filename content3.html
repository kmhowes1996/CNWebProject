        <h5>Concept Alternative Armors</h5>
<p>Alternative armor designs for the player. Each with their own perks. The SPIRIT armor would have increased damage and speed but would restrict the player to melee only, as well as decreased the player's max health. Successful kills would give the player health back, as well as overheal. The GALACTIC armor would have improved player movement in zero-gravity zones. Drawn in 2019</p>
